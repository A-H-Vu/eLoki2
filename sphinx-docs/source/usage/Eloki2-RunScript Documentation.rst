  Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is
  determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s

Eloki2-RunScript Module
#######################

The replay/script runner module is used to replay sessions captured/recorded by the capture module. Click [here](Eloki2-Capture Documentation.html) for the documentation on the capture module. When run, the 



Usage
*****

.. code-block:: console

    $ java -jar eLoki2.jar [--headless] [--driver DRIVERFILE] [--client CLIENT] [--proxy address:port] [--useragent UA] run <script> [script options]

\<script\> is the location of the script file(s) recorded by the capture module.



Options
*******


--------
--driver
--------

The path to the driver for Selenium, this is either the geckodriver file or the chromedriver file depending on the selenium client specified in the *--client* option.



The path must include any extensions the file may have (.exe on windows for example). Additionally for the chromedriver to work you may have to follow the additional instructions to allow it to find your chrome installation.


--------
--client
--------

The client to use, currently the only options are ``SeleniumChrome`` and ``SeleniumFirefox`` for Selenium using Chrome and Firefox respectively. Additionally the driver must be specified using the ``--driver`` option


----------
--headless
----------

Start the browser in headless mode hiding it. 


-------
--proxy
-------

The proxy to use, by default no proxy is used. The type of proxy used is a socks5 proxy. The proxy is specified in the following format ``address:port`` where the address is either the ip address of the proxy or is domain name i.e. 127.0.0.1, localhost etc. The port is the port that the socks5 proxy is open on and must be a number from 0 to 65535. This flag can be used to connect to the tor network if the tor browser is open and connected as follows ``--proxy 127.0.0.1:9150``

-----------
--useragent
-----------

Changes the useragent string that the browser uses.

Script Options
**************


------------
--randomMove
------------

Randomizes the movement of the mouse in a naive fashion. Every action that moves its mouse will have its co-ordinates changed to a random point in a 11x11 grid centered on the original co-ordinates. i.e. an action that moves the mouse to (25,25) will have its value randomized to any point within the grid from (20,20) to (30,30) inclusive. There is also a check to make sure that the randomized point is within the 30 degree angle formed from the lines 15 degrees out on either side when drawing a line from the previous/next point to the current point. This is to ensure that the mouse trajectory remains relatively similar to the original trajectory.


-----------
--batchMove
-----------

Combines mousemove actions that are in sequence into a single batchmove action. Actions are grouped if there are no other non-mouse movement actions in between and if the scroll position is the same for all actions. With the Selenium browsers this may help with choppy/laggy mouse movement due to actions being skipped. This option will cause the --naturalMove option to be ignored.


----------------------
--naturalMove \[type\]
----------------------

Replaces the mousemove actions that are in sequence into a naturalmove action. Actions are grouped if there are no other non-mouse movement actions in between and if the scroll position is the same for all actions. The naturalmove action uses the `NaturalMouseMotion <https://github.com/JoonasVali/NaturalMouseMotion>`_ library to generate the mouse movement between the starting and end point, determined by the first and last point in the sequence of mousemoves grouped. The type option specifies the manner in which the mouse is moved and can be one of ``[granny|gamer|average]``. 
This option is ignored if ``--batchMove`` is set.
